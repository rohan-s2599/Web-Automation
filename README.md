🤖Welcome to Robot Framework Automation!!🤖
▪️ This Framework consists of 5 main folders (Global, Pages, Keywords, Results & Tests).
▪️ I'm following Page Object Model (POM) as it is simple & easy to maintain & use.
▪️ I'm using 2 types of configuration files for scripting (.resource & .robot).
▪️ .resource files contains the steps/locators/actions while .robot files contain Test Cases ready for execution.
▪️ Global folder contains 2 files (Global.resource & GlobalLocators.resource), one file contains all the common keywords/actions & other file conatins all the common locators which can be useful for all the pages of an application.    
▪️ Pages folder contains individual files dedicated to each module/feature of an applictaion for containing locators of the corresponding module.
▪️ Keywords folder contains individual files dedicated to each module/feature of an applictaion for performing actions in the corresponding module.
▪️ Tests folder contains individual files dedicated to each module/feature of an application for containing test cases of the corresponding module.
▪️ Results folder conatins .html/.xml files which is nothing but the execution/log reports.
